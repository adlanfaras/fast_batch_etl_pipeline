# Fast Batch ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This project is a fast and efficient batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to handle large volumes of data with minimal latency. The pipeline is built to be scalable, reliable, and easy to configure for various data sources and destinations.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast data processing and minimal latency.
- **Scalability**: Easily handles increasing volumes of data.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to handle and log errors.
- **Configurable**: Simple configuration for different data sources and targets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fast-batch-etl-pipeline.git
    cd fast-batch-etl-pipeline
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Configure your data sources and destinations in the `config.yaml` file.
2. Run the ETL pipeline:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to set up your data sources, transformations, and destinations. Example configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  - type: mysql
    host: your-database-host
    port: 3306
    database: your-database
    username: your-username
    password: your-password

transformations:
  - type: clean_data
  - type: aggregate

destinations:
  - type: s3
    bucket: your-s3-bucket
    path: /data/output/
